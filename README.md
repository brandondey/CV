# Brandon's CV

I stand on the shoulders of (LaTex) giants. My CV is based on a template I found for **Awesome CV**, which is LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)**, **Résumé** or **Cover Letter** inspired by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv). It is easy to customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean, semantic markup.
